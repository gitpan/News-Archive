Revision history for Perl extension News::Archive

0.14		Tue May 25 14:38:31 CDT 2004 
	- 'use warnings' through many modules.  Fixes to CGIs and various
	  scripts.  Changed write-out behaviour of News::Active and
	  News::GroupInfo.

0.13		Tue May 25 12:42:19 CDT 2004
	- Added 'readonly' bits; it'll tide us over until we've got 
	  file locking done.

0.12		Thu Apr 29 13:50:07 CDT 2004
	- Populated kibozerc.pod
	- Minor bugfixes.

0.11		Thu Apr 29 12:07:34 CDT 2004 
	- News::Article::Mbox - falls back if the message wasn't a valid
	  mbox to just looking at it as a single message.
        - News::Archive - added some close functions.
	- mbox2news.pl - now works on mboxes with just one message (or non-
	  mboxes, as the case may be).  Got rid of newsarchive.pl accordingly.
	- Added newsrecurse.pl.

0.10		Wed Apr 28 17:00:44 CDT 2004 
	- First releasable version; I'm far from releasing it though.
