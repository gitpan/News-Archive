Revision history for Perl extension News::Archive

0.11		Thu Apr 29 12:07:34 CDT 2004 
	- News::Article::Mbox - falls back if the message wasn't a valid
	  mbox to just looking at it as a single message.
        - News::Archive - added some close functions.
	- mbox2news.pl - now works on mboxes with just one message (or non-
	  mboxes, as the case may be).  Got rid of newsarchive.pl accordingly.
	- Added newsrecurse.pl.

0.10		Wed Apr 28 17:00:44 CDT 2004 
	- First releasable version; I'm far from releasing it though.
